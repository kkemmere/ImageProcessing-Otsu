# Image Processing Otsu's method of thresholding
Image processing project using Otsu's method of thresholding using Python, Jupyter Notebook
<br/>
The whole idea for this project was for me to test and compare Otsu's method to kNN/K-Means thresholding
<br/>
<br/>
Created by Kevin Kemmerer in Digital Image Processing
- kNN(k-nearest neighbor) initially requires some already known information so K-means thesholding was chosen instead.
- This K-means algo requires changing k value in the code depending on the number of colors in an image.

# Small GUI so user can input image. In this case "demo.jpg" was input
