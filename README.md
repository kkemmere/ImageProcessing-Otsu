# ImageProcessing Otsu's method of thresholding
<br/>
Image processing project using Otsu's method of thresholding using Python, Jupyter Notebook
Created by Kevin Kemmerer in Digital Image Processing
The whole idea for this project was for me to test and compare Otsu's method to kNN/K-Means thresholding
- kNN(k-nearest neighbor) initially requires some already known information so K-means thesholding was chosen instead

# Original Input Image "demo.jpg"

# Small GUI so user can input image. In this case "demo.jpg" was input[
