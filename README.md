# Image Processing Otsu's method of thresholding
Image processing project using Otsu's method of thresholding using Python, Jupyter Notebook
<br/>
The whole idea for this project was for me to test and compare Otsu's method to kNN/K-Means thresholding

- kNN(k-nearest neighbor) initially requires some already known information so K-means thesholding was chosen instead.
- This K-means algo requires changing k value in the code depending on the number of colors in an image.
- K-Means is a Machine Learning algorithm and in this instance is used for <b>Clustering</b> K amount of clusters
- <br/>
<b>Clustering:</b> Is the process of using Machine Learning and algorithms to identify how different types of data are related and creating new segments based on those relationships.
- In this program K is the amount of clusters

# Small GUI so user can input image. In this case "demo.jpg" was input
